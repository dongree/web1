        <h2>Samsung Lions?</h2>

        <p>The Samsung Lions (Korean: 삼성 라이온즈) are a South Korean professional baseball team founded in 1982.
          They are based in the southeastern city of Daegu and are members of the KBO League. Their home stadium is Daegu Samsung Lions Park.
          They have won the Korean Series eight times (they have also finished runner-up ten times).
          The Samsung Lions is the first team to win four consecutive Korean Series titles (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014).
          The Samsung Lions are also the first Korean team ever to win a regular league title for five consecutive years (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015).
        </p>
        <h3>history</h3>
        <p>
          The Samsung Lions were founded in 1982 as one of the original six KBO League teams.
          They won their first championship in 1985, going 40-14-1 in the first half and 37-18 in the second half for a total of
          77–32 for the best one-season winning percentage in KBO League history (a record that still stands). The 1985 team had two 25-game-winners on their staff,
          Kim Si-jin and Kim ll-young; as the Lions were winners of both half-season pennants that year, no Korean Series was held and the Lions were declared champions outright.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lions would also win the championship in 2002, 2005 and 2006, having the best record in each one of those years.
          In 2010, Ryu Jung-il was hired as the new manager of the Samsung Lions.
          He led the team to the best record in the league and its fifth KBO title in 2011.
          After the KBO League, the Samsung Lions won the Asian Series championship.
          The Samsung Lions became the first team to win the pennant race, the Korean Series, and the Asian Series in the same year.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2012, one of the most notable players on the team, Lee Seung-yuop, returned to South Korea from Japan.
          With his help, the Samsung Lions won their sixth championship in the 2012 season.
          They won another two championships in 2013 and 2014, for a total of eight Korean Series championships.
          In 2016, Samsung Lions moved to their new stadium, Daegu Samsung Lions Park.
